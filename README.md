# LibraryCheckoutAPI
A simple library esc API which allows Customers to checkout books, movies, and more.


This project in its current state (0.1) is very rudimentery and only has very basic buisness logic.
in future revisions of the project, i would like to add checks for the type of item being checked out, stock of the items themselves, and other various little things
